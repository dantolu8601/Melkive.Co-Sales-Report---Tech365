# Tools Used
- Power BI (for building the dashboard)

# Process

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
   - Utilized Power Query to remove duplicate entries, correct datatypes for each column, and eliminate blank cells.  
   - Added new columns for month, year, and day derived from the date column.  

2. Dashboard Design
   - Imported the cleaned data into Power BI to build an interactive dashboard.  
   - Visualized sales trends, regional performance, and other key metrics.  

3. Implementation 
   - Established relationships between sheets, using the “Data” sheet as the primary key and others as foreign keys to automate analysis.  
   - Created calculated columns for total revenue, product category revenue, and regional performance using the “New Measure” tool.  
   - Designed an interactive dashboard with filters for year, region, and product category.  

4. Visualizations
   - Line charts for tracking sales trends over time.  
   - Bar charts for revenue by region and team performance.  
   - Pie charts for product category revenue breakdown.  
   - Cards displaying key metrics such as total revenue, number of regions, number of products, most purchased product, and total purchases.  
   - Half-doughnut chart to visualize total revenue.  

5. Testing and Validation  
   - Ensured all calculations and visualizations were correct and functional.

# Recommendation

•	APAC is the leading market; invest in marketing, supply chain efficiency, and customer engagement initiatives there to maintain dominance.

•	Since "Bars" are the most purchased product category, more resources can be allocated to improve their availability and promote them in underperforming regions (e.g., Europe).

•	Europe's revenue and profit lag significantly, a market analysis can be conducted to identify potential barriers (e.g., pricing, marketing, distribution issues) and address them.

•	Recognize and reward high-performing teams like Juckle and Delish while providing additional training and resources for lower-performing teams like Tempo.

•	Although "Bars" dominate, ensure growth in the "Bliss" category and explore innovations to create new product lines or variations to capture more market share. This strategy ensures the business isn't overly dependent on just one product category and has room to grow in other areas

•	Leverage the popularity of 85% Dark Bars in marketing campaigns, especially in new or lagging regions.
